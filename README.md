PRITrans
Protein-RNA interactions are essential for numerous cellular processes, and missense mutations in RNA-binding proteins can disrupt these interactions, contributing to disease pathogenesis. 
This study introduces a novel computational method, PRITrans, utilizing the Transformer module to predict the effects of missense mutations in RNA-binding proteins on protein-RNA interactions. 
PRITrans combines evolutionary scale modeling (ESM-2) and ProtTrans (PT) context sequence features to elucidate protein biochemical properties.
